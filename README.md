This repository demonstrates the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a specification and set of tools for enabling AI models and agents to interact with external systems, such as code repositories, APIs, and other services, in a structured and secure way. MCP provides a standardized context for models to:

- Access and modify resources (like files, issues, or pull requests)
- Authenticate and authorize actions
- Maintain context across multiple operations
- Integrate with developer workflows

MCP is designed to make AI agents more useful, safe, and auditable when working with real-world systems.

## Key Features
- Standardized API for model actions
- Secure authentication and authorization
- Context management for multi-step operations
- Extensible to various platforms and services
